# Horizontal Thrust Measuring Stage

A stage to measure horizontral thrust generated by rocket engine.

This is a project created by students in The Aviation Club of the [Second High School Atteched to Beijing Normal University](https://www.shsbnu.net/index.html).

# Highlights

We use Arduino Mega 2560 and HX711 to record and store the magnitude of the thrust into the program, and graph the associated function (force @ time).

- **0-20kg** measuring range _(maximum value not to exceed 30kg)_
- 30-50mm engine diameter fit
- 10Hz sample rate
- Real-time display
- SD card data writing
